Had the responsibility to design and develop the fundamental user interface for all websites at the International Trade Administration. 

Collaboated with the Salesforce and Webservices teams for a smooth handoff.

User generated sites, using a SFDC page builder called "WebApp". This tool allows users to create and deploy websites with no development necessary.

Most pages showcase promational atom content. To complete the site: a single sign-on user portal, API genereated search apps, an eCommerce app, and many published articles:

Had the opportunity to design and develop the fundamental website for the International Trade Administration. 

Underneath, using a custom Salesforce site builder application called "WebApp", buisness users created many data-driven websites.

The site and page elements are configurable. The content is atomized into bite size pieces. Other options include adding an API genereated site search, an eCommerce app, and a article library. 

All websites fall under a single sign-on portal which allows users to view the same content across community domains.

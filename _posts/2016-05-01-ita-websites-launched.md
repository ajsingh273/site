Had the responsibility to design and build the fundamental user interface for all websites at the International Trade Administration. 

User generated sites, using a SFDC built "web app". This tool allows users to configure their entire website (similar to Wix, but for the federal government).

Most pages showcase promational content. To complete the site: a single sign-on user portal, API genereated search apps, an eCommerce app, and many published articles:
